Overview:

This Java-based software is designed to assist users in navigating the Delhi Metro system efficiently. It helps identify the best routes,
including line changes, using graph traversal algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). 

Features:

Graph-Based Route Calculation: Utilizes BFS for shortest paths and DFS for exploring all possible routes.

Multi-Line Navigation: Handles transitions between different metro lines seamlessly.

Real-Time Updates: Cloud integration ensures up-to-date information on metro schedules and line statuses.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive for users to input source and destination stations.

Scalable Design: Suitable for expanding to other metro systems in the future.
